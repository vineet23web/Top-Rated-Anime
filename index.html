        <h2>Naruto Shippuden</h2>

        <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
        <p>
          Naruto Uzumaki, is a loud, hyperactive, adolescent ninja who
          constantly searches for approval and recognition, as well as to become
          Hokage, who is acknowledged as the leader and strongest of all ninja
          in the village. Naruto Uzumaki wants to be the best ninja in the land.
          He's done well so far, but with the looming danger posed by the
          mysterious Akatsuki organization, Naruto knows he must train harder
          than ever and leaves his village for intense exercises that will push
          him to his limits.Naruto Shippuden is the second series of Naruto
          anime that follows the titular hero on his quest to become Hokage.
          Unlike the first series, Naruto is now older and has new teachers to
          help him through his adventure. At the same time, he faces the biggest
          threats to the five shinobi nations and must deal with the loss of
          someone he considers a brother. While the original series was filled
          with serious issues, Shippuden dialed everything up a notch, thrusting
          Naruto into a world of war, death, and betrayal. Heâ€™s not a kid
          anymore and the gloves have come off.

        <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
        <p>
          The appearance of "quirks," newly discovered super powers, has been
          steadily increasing over the years, with 80 percent of humanity
          possessing various abilities from manipulation of elements to
          shape-shifting etc. The 20 percent of mankind who do not possess a
          power are called "quirkless", and are usually looked down on upon the
          supernatural community. Academies across the globe train their
          students to learn to fight crime with their powers. Izuku Midoriya, a
          boy born without any powers, dreams of being able to become a super
          hero too, but gets bullied for his unrealistic dreams. One day, his
          fate changes in an unexpected meeting with the no.1 hero all might,
          and he is given the chance to become his successor and inherent one
          for all, a quirk with a dark history, which is passed down from
          successor to successor, who cultivates it with their own power and
          passes it on, to defeat it's brother, all for one.

        <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
        <p>
          After their mother's death, Edward Elric and his younger brother,
          Alphonse, try using alchemy to bring her back to life. Unfortunately
          they do not fully take into account the law of equivalent exchange
          which requires a sacrifice of equal value to what one hopes to
          achieve. Not only do they fail to revive their mother but Edward loses
          an arm and a leg and Alphonse loses his entire body, forcing his soul
          to remain confined to an empty suit of armor. Seeking a way to restore
          their bodies, Edward becomes a state alchemist and the brothers begin
          a long search for the legendary Philosopher's Stone, an object
          purported to allow its users to ignore the law of equivalent exchange.

        <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
        <p>
          The story follows a young boy named Gon Freecss, who was told all his
          life that both his parents were dead. But when he learns from Kite, an
          apprentice of his father Ging Freecss, that he is still alive and has
          since become an accomplished Hunter, Gon leaves his home on Whale
          Island to take the Hunter Examination in order to become a Hunter like
          him. During the exam, Gon meets and soon befriends three of the other
          applicants: Kurapika, the last remaining member of the Kurta clan who
          wishes to become a Hunter in order to avenge his clan and recover
          their scarlet-glowing eyes that were plucked from their corpses by a
          band of thieves known as the Phantom Troupe; Leorio, a prospective
          physician who, in order to pay for medical school, desires the
          financial benefits that Hunters receive; and Killua Zoldyck, another
          twelve-year-old boy who has left his former life as a member of the
          world's most notorious assassin family. Among many other examinees,
          Gon continuously encounters Hisoka, a mysterious and deadly transmuter
          who takes an interest in him. After passing by many trials together,
          Gon and his friends end up passing the exam except for Killua, who
          fails after killing another applicant due to the influence of his
          brother, Illumi, and runs away to his family's estate in shame.
